# Protein Conservation

From a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) in FASTA format and a corresponding PDB protein structure, sequence identity at each alignment position is computed and map it onto the PDB file in the B-factor position.

If a MSA of the protein is not available, create_MSA.py script can be used.
